As you may be aware, I am a student of engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). If there's one thing I've learned from my many years in the education system, it's that knowing more about your obstacles can help you conquer them. That's why I'm putting down the classes I took at TMU so that incoming TMU students know what they're in for and may better prepare themselves. I hope that every prospective TMU student has a fantastic time here.

## MTH140 - Calculus 1

    Difficulty: 5/10

The majority of this course focused on high school pre-calculus and calculus. The first half of the course included pre-calculus topics such as advanced function, limits, continuity, and so on. The second part focused on calculus concepts such as differentiation and derivatives. Fortunately, I got into a section with Prof.Majed El-Qasas; to be honest, he was a wizard because he made everything about math look easy. THis class did not have a final but they had a 3 tests which is 30% of the course for a test and they also had weekly quiz for 10%.

## CEN100 - Introduction to Engineering

    Difficulty: 0/10

No offence, but this class was a huge joke. It taught you about each engineering branch and what they perform. Working on projects was a lot of fun (I would enjoy it more if I can have it in-person tho). There are iclickers in this class, and they are generally graded, but they are only worth 10% and are judged on accuracy rather than participation. The final was not difficult provided you paid attention in class and understood what each discipline of engineering does. Overall, the lesson is rather simple, with an A-/A grade.

## PCS211 - Physics: Mechanics

    Difficulty: ∞/10

This course is taught by Prof. Catherine Beachemin. Many people disliked her teaching style, but I appreciated how she explained physics ideas. It was simple and easy to comprehend, but she had an issue in that she did not teach much. As a result, I had to teach myself everything. This was a difficult course. Seriously, because this course had a rigorous grading structure, I spent the majority of my leisure time tackling physics questions. if you are taking, or are about to take, this course, be prepared to devote all of your time to physics.

## MTH141 - Linear Algebra

    Difficulty: 8/10

This was a difficult math class, especially without adequate knowledge about vectors in high school. Aside from that, the course went at a tremendous speed, so I had to focus on this class and complete as many practice problems as I could.

## CHY102 - Chemistry

    Difficulty: 4/10

Despite the fact that I have always disliked chemistry because it is a difficult subject, this class was one of my favourites because the professors were so amazing and made the material as simple and easy to understand as possible. In fact, my professor makes it so simple that even a toddler can understand the chemistry concept. The fact that this lesson was asynchronous and you had the full week to complete it is another plus. This class is generally recommended with a 10.

## PHL110 - Philosophy of religions

    Difficulty: 8/10

I hate this class with a passion. I do this course just because it is my liberal and there’ is no other liberal to do. Even though I have lots of interest in religions this course literally the opposite of what I think it is. I do not have the mind for philosophy and I always fall asleep in the class. I have a really bad experience with this class in term of learning. The grading is not too difficult because all I have to do are to go to class (10%), 3 quizzes throughout the term (20% each) and a term paper with 2500 words max (30%). If you are a person that are interested in Philosophy and also religions, you should take this class, else, don’t.

## FRE201 - Introductory French II

    Difficulty: 5/10 

This class is ok. The material isn’t too hard for people that have already known French. My professor is a really chill and funny person, she is very helpful also! You just need a little bit of concentration and do homework for this class then you are fine.

## ECN801 - Engineering Economics

    Difficulty: 7/10

A pain in the 4ss I must say. Even though the material is not too hard, it’s about interest rate, time period, present value, future value, MMAR, IRR, etc. But the calculation is what makes the course hard because it has too many numbers and it is really prone to errors. A problem that you want to solve manually by hands will take you to 20-30 minutes at least. However,  I have found a way to do it quicker. I programmed an entire Excel sheet just for this class and all I need to do is to enter variables and I will have the answer in no time. I also reccommend future Engineering students who are going to take this course do the same approach as me and you will thank me later. You can look at my [Excel](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1alKPBq-gp0N3wXtiheqiC0PdVfmqGHj9UCT4bmhMPeg/edit?usp=sharing) sheet for reference.

Will update in the near future!
