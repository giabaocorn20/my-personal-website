As you may be aware, I am a student of engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU). If there's one thing I've learned from my many years in the education system, it's that knowing more about your obstacles can help you conquer them. That's why I'm putting down the classes I took at TMU so that incoming TMU students know what they're in for and may better prepare themselves. I hope that every prospective TMU student has a fantastic time here.

## MTH140 - Calculus 1

    Difficulty: 5/10

The majority of this course focused on high school pre-calculus and calculus. The first half of the course included pre-calculus topics such as advanced function, limits, continuity, and so on. The second part focused on calculus concepts such as differentiation and derivatives. Fortunately, I got into a section with Prof.Majed El-Qasas; to be honest, he was a wizard because he made everything about math look easy. THis class did not have a final but they had a 3 tests which is 30% of the course for a test and they also had weekly quiz for 10%.

## CEN100 - Introduction to Engineering

    Difficulty: 0/10

No offence, but this class was a huge joke. It taught you about each engineering branch and what they perform. Working on projects was a lot of fun (I would enjoy it more if I can have it in-person tho). There are iclickers in this class, and they are generally graded, but they are only worth 10% and are judged on accuracy rather than participation. The final was not difficult provided you paid attention in class and understood what each discipline of engineering does. Overall, the lesson is rather simple, with an A-/A grade.

## PCS211 - Physics: Mechanics

    Difficulty: âˆž/10

This course is taught by Prof. Catherine Beachemin. Many people disliked her teaching style, but I appreciated how she explained physics ideas. It was simple and easy to comprehend, but she had an issue in that she did not teach much. As a result, I had to teach myself everything. This was a difficult course. Seriously, because this course had a rigorous grading structure, I spent the majority of my leisure time tackling physics questions. if you are taking, or are about to take, this course, be prepared to devote all of your time to physics.

## MTH141 - Linear Algebra

    Difficulty: 8/10

This was a difficult math class, especially if you did not understand vectors adequately in high school. Aside from that, the course went at a tremendous speed, so if I were you, I would focus on this class and complete as many practice problems as I could.

## CHY102 - Chemistry

    Difficulty: 4/10

Despite the fact that I have always disliked chemistry because it is a difficult subject, this class was one of my favourites because the professors were so amazing and made the material as simple and easy to understand as possible. In fact, my professor makes it so simple that even a toddler can understand the chemistry concept. The fact that this lesson was asynchronous and you had the full week to complete it is another plus. This class is generally recommended with a 10.

Will update in the near future!
